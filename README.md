After a somewhat extended break from HTML5 UP (to work on a secret-ish new project -- more on that later!), I'm back with a brand new design: Solid State. It's a slick new multipager that combines some of the ideas I've played with over at Pixelarity with an "angular" sort of look. Hope you dig it :)
